lcurses is a C library for Lua 5.1 that wraps the curses API. It is
copyright Tiago Dionizio <tiago.dionizio@gmail.com> 2004-2007 and
copyright Reuben Thomas 2009-2011, and is released under the MIT
license, like Lua (see http://www.lua.org/copyright.html; it's
basically the same as the BSD license). There is no warranty.

Installation
------------

As normal:

[If using git sources:

    ./autogen.sh
]

    ./configure && make [&& make install]

The following options may be of interest if you have Lua installed on
non-default paths (as you are likely to on any system supporting more
than one version of Lua):

  --libdir=DIR            Install shared library in this directory
  --with-lua-prefix=DIR   Lua files are in DIR
  --with-lua-suffix=ARG   Lua binary and library files are suffixed with ARG

For example, on Debian or Ubuntu:

  CPPFLAGS=/usr/include/lua5.1 ./configure --libdir=/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1 --with-lua-suffix=5.1


Use
---

Unfortunately, there's currently no documentation other than
lcurses.c. It's fairly straightforward, though.

GNU Zile 2.4.0 and later is written in Lua, using lcurses, so it
contains plenty of example code. See the lua branch of its git
repository at: http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/zile.git
