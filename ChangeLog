	compiler-warning: fix 'discards qualifiers from pointer' gcc  warning
	Simply throwing a `const char *` pointer into a plain `char *` type
	parameter breaks the contract between curses function prototypes in the
	API and the caller.

	Without any additional compiler flags, before this changeset (and after
	the last reverted changeset has been applied), compilation with gcc
	yields:

	  lcurses.c: In function 'ti_getflag':
	  lcurses.c:1838: warning: passing argument 1 of 'tigetflag' discards qualifiers from pointer target type
	  lcurses.c: In function 'ti_getnum':
	  lcurses.c:1849: warning: passing argument 1 of 'tigetnum' discards qualifiers from pointer target type
	  lcurses.c: In function 'ti_getstr':
	  lcurses.c:1862: warning: passing argument 1 of 'tigetstr' discards qualifiers from pointer target type

	When using `-Werror`, as added by `./configure --enable-gcc-warnings`,
	this correctly prevents compilation succeeding.  Instead, we use
	`strlcpy` to make a copy that can be safely mangled inside curses
	functions (and to save memory, we use a single static buffer for all the
	`tigetfoo` wrapper calls.

2011-09-08  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@vaughan.pe>

	Revert "Avoid using strlcpy, a non-standard function."
	This reverts commit a6e1585de2c1d5668393b539ab187d18b02ad1f1.

	Revert "Cast capname arguments to avoid compiler warnings."
	This reverts commit 1f4531f145bf4d8de7fb011d1c7cdb7bb12da0df.

2011-09-07  Reuben Thomas  <rrt@sc3d.org>

	Remove fixed FIXME.

	Merge pull request #2 from gvvaughan/pull-request/portable-shared-lib-extension
	test: ask libtool for objdir and shrext

	Cast capname arguments to avoid compiler warnings.

2011-09-07  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@vaughan.pe>

	hygiene: fix warnings from gl_ADD_WARN flags

	configury: pass gl_WARN_ADD results to gcc
	gl_WARN_ADD results were not being substituted into Makefile.in
	correctly. Add a --enable-gcc-warnings configure flag, and when
	passed, compile with all the warning flags that were successfully
	tested at configure time.

	configury: invoke missing gl_INIT macro
	gnulib doesn't work properly unless configure invokes both of gl_INIT
	and gl_EARLY.

	configury: upgrade broken autogen.sh to bootstrap
	manage gnulib submodule, bootstrapped gnulib files, and other assorted
	improvements from adopting bootstrap script (slated for gnulib
	adoption).

	Revert "[configury] Autoconf version 2.61 compatibility"
	This reverts commit ef4c0fc966978f5fb9abea35203ae4f1fd0b205e.

2011-04-03  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	Revert "[Configury] Search for and link against liblua."
	It turns out that there is no need to link the modules against
	the liblua dylib to avoid crashiness, and doing so prevents using
	an alternative runtime (luajit), so reverted this patch.

	This reverts commit 87e20e11afb53fa3910fa092a16620a7549260ad.

2011-04-02  Gary V. Vaughan  <gary@gnu.org>

	[Configury] Search for and link against liblua.
	I've discovered that the best way to avoid crashiness when running
	Lua on Mac OS 10.6 with runtime binary modules is to build lua itself
	with a liblua.dylib, and then link the lua interpreter and all the
	modules slavishly against that same dylib. This patch makes sure
	lcurses behaves accordingly.

	[configury] Autoconf version 2.61 compatibility
	Mac OS 10.6.7 still ships with Autoconf-2.61, which is prior to
	bug-fixes relied on by the warnings and manywarnings gnulib
	modules.  This patch allows bootstrapping a fresh clone of the
	repo without first installing the latest autoconf.

	[configury] Support Automake versions < 1.11
	Mac OS 10.6.7 still ships with Automake-1.10, which doesn't support
	the AM_SILENT_RULES macro.  This patch allows bootstrapping a fresh
	clone of the repo without first installing the latest automake.
